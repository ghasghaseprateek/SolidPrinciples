SOLID are five basic principles which help to create good software architecture. SOLID is an acronym where:-

S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle
O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)
L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)
I stands for ISP ( Interface segregation principle)
D stands for DIP ( Dependency inversion principle)

# SRP
A class should have only one responsibility and not multiple.

# OCP
Open for extension and closed for modification

# LSP
The parent should easily replace the child object

# ISP
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

# DIP
High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction.
